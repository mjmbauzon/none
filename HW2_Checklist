//Please mark the requirement you have finished. And mark the requirement you are working on (so others won't work on it)


Minimum Requirements:
    You should add dynamic behavior to at least three pages of your site (I think we finished this one)
        This dynamic behavior should be working towards your final project goal
        If you are building a single page app, then you should take the three distinct pages that you created for HW1 and now have them as 3 different views on the same page (and add dynamic behavior to each)

    Perform DOM manipulation  
        Create multiple views (what does this mean?)
        Use history manipulation so that “back” just takes you to a different view
        Programmatically create HTML, including (at least):
            Dynamically create container elements (which contain items) in a list (what does this mean? )
            Use at least one data-* attribute
        Use at least one event listener
        
    Use good coding style 
        Follow all of the best practices & style rules of HW1
        Make identifier names understandable
        Use proper and consistent indentation
        Use comments
